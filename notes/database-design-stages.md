# 📐 Database Design Process

This process outlines the progressive stages of database design from conceptualization to physical implementation.

> 🔁 **Note:** The design process is often **iterative** — later discoveries may lead you to revisit earlier steps to refine entities, constraints, or performance strategies.

## 🧠 Conceptual Design (Section 9.4)

> 🎯 **Goal:** Understand user requirements and convert them into abstract models  
> 📄 **Deliverables:** ER diagrams, business rule documentation, initial normalization  
> 🛠 **Tools:** Lucidchart, draw.io, Notion, whiteboard

| Step                               | Activities                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data analysis and requirements     | - Determine end-user views, outputs, and transaction requirements          |
| Entity Relationship modeling       | - Define entities, attributes, domains, and relationships                  |
| and normalization                  | - Begin ER diagrams and normalization                                     |
| Data model verification            | - Identify modules and validate access rights                             |
|                                    | - Define views, reports, queries, validation rules, integrity, access, and security requirements |
| Distributed database design\*      | - Define fragmentation and allocation strategy                            |

## 🧩 DBMS Selection (Section 9.5)

> 🎯 **Goal:** Choose an appropriate DBMS platform and logical model  
> 📄 **Deliverables:** DBMS evaluation criteria, selected platform justification  
> 🛠 **Tools:** Vendor whitepapers, benchmarking tools, DBMS comparison matrix

| Step             | Activities                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Select the DBMS  | - Determine DBMS and data model to use |

## 🧮 Logical Design (Section 9.6)

> 🎯 **Goal:** Translate conceptual models into normalized, integrity-bound logical schemas  
> 📄 **Deliverables:** Logical schema, entity/table definitions, normalized sets  
> 🛠 **Tools:** ERD tools, database modeling software (MySQL Workbench, dbdiagram.io)

| Step                                | Activities                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Map conceptual model to logical     | - Define tables, columns, relationships, and constraints                   |
| Validate logical model using        | - Normalize set of tables                                                  |
| normalization                       |                                                                            |
| Validate logical model integrity    | - Enforce entity and referential integrity, define indexes                 |
| Validate logical model against user| - Ensure the model supports user requirements                              |
| requirements                        |                                                                            |

## 🏗️ Physical Design (Section 9.7)

> 🎯 **Goal:** Optimize data storage and query performance within the constraints of selected hardware and DBMS  
> 📄 **Deliverables:** Indexing strategy, partitioning, physical schema design  
> 🛠 **Tools:** Query profilers, indexing simulators, DBMS config settings

| Step                              | Activities                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Define data storage organization  | - Define tables, indexes, and view physical organization                   |
| Define integrity and security     | - Establish access rules, views, and access controls                       |
| measures                          |                                                                            |

## 📝 Key Takeaways

- Each stage refines the system from abstract concepts to physical implementation.
- DBMS selection bridges theoretical design with real-world limitations.
- Conceptual and logical designs should remain independent of hardware constraints.
- Physical design is crucial for scaling, performance, and maintenance efficiency.
- This process applies whether you’re working on OLTP, OLAP, or distributed systems.
